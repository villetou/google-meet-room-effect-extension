# Google Meet background chatter extension
A Chrome extension for Google Meet, which applies a room reverb sound effect to the audio when your meeting tab is in the background.

Why use it? You might want to keep a meeting open throughout the day, but push the meeting audio back so you can hear your colleagues' nice warm chatter in the background. It's almost like you're back in the year 2019!

This extension is a work-in-progress beta alpha: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND DISCRETION!
