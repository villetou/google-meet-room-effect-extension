# Google Meet Room Audio Effect
A Chrome extension for Google Meet, which applies a room reverb sound effect to the audio when your meeting tab is in the background.

Why use it? You might want to keep a meeting open throughout the day, but push the meeting audio back so you can hear your colleagues' nice warm chatter in the background without being too distracting. It's almost like you're back in the year 2019!
